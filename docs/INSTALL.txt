Installation
============

Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.

* Add ``edrn.theme`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        edrn.theme
        
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        edrn.theme
        
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    % ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
