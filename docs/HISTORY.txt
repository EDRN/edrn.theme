Changelog
=========

What follows is a history of changes from release to release.  For issue IDs
mentioned below, you can learn more about them by visiting the issue tracker
at https://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/jira/browse/CA.

1.2.1 — Upgrades
----------------

• Made compatible with Plone 4.1.5.
• CA-983 - unencrypted login form


1.2.0 — Plone 4.1
-----------------

This release makes the EDRN theme compatible with Plone 4.1.  It also upgrades
the test harness to use the plone.app.testing fixtures.

It also repairs a long-standing issue (CA-747): the logged_out template has a
form where you can immediately log in again if you require.  However, the
Apache circuitry sends that form out over HTTP, and the form action inherits
that HTTP, when it should go over HTTPS.  The EDRN theme removes the form.
 

1.1.2 — Icons
-------------

This release adds icons (and corresponding CSS) for the QuickLinks portlet,
including the Collaborative Groups icon with hover effect.


1.1.1 — Upgrade Cleanup
-----------------------

This release includes the following:

* No more horrible padding that's been appearing on the left side of virtually
  every damn span everywhere.
* New unit test to check for customized login_form and the new login_form.
* Hidden labels of class hiddenStructure that are for accessibility only.
* Making the labels on the add/remove addons list appear reasonable.
* Bringing in customizations made TTW at NCI that worked around IE7 display
  issues.
* Upgrade steps to profile 4.


1.1.0 — Plone 4
---------------

This release makes edrn.theme compatible with Plone 4.

1.0.0 — Fantasizing on Facetizing
---------------------------------

After being in production for several months we've decided to call it version
1 at last.  However, this release also adds styling for future faceted
navigation features.  It also adds styling and imagery for the Members List
button for the QuickLinks portlet.

It also addresses the following issues:

* CA-642 - Create a new member page
* CA-666 - Sites Page clean up
